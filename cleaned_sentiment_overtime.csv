2025-06-09T20:00:00.000-05:00,2025-06-09T21:00:00.000-05:00,"i was actually really excited for a lot of the updates, especially as someone who came into this thinking it will be a miss:

- i like the overall design, i love that we have more floating ui
- i like the lockscreen changes
- i like all the new messages additions, i feel like everyone's been asking for more features and group typing animations
- i loved the carplay changes, live activities + no more full screen calls
- call screening + call hold are amazing qol features
- live translation (on paper) is very useful
- apple music live mixing or whatever that's called is sick
- admitting the f'd up the photos app and giving us back that tab was great

i am way more excited about features this ios than last ios. ipad os was amazing too with the new files app, preview (both should have came to iphone too btw) and inching it closer to macos. i was laughing when they showed the window management and the hidden menu bar, like bruh just let us boot macos already.

additionally as a mac user i really liked live activities syncing, shortcut updates, and ripping of raycast (lol) but it was pretty barren of an update. although you can only do so much. funny seeing vista-like ui elements on mac almost two decades later though lol.

biggest miss was obviously ai. i really wished they would have provided some deeper integration with third party ais or something to bridge the gap. i love using perplexity's assistant mode and it feels like an alpha version of what an ai assistant looks like on ios.",positive

electronics have reached that point too. we've been at peak smartphones, peak laptops, peak computers, peak cameras, and peak operating systems for several years. unless there are breakthroughs in physics, this is where we are for the foreseeable future.
