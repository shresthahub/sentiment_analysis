That was probably my longest one yet. The sheer volume of info they can cram in and still shave off half an hour vs the old live events is insane. Anyways, here's your AI break so enjoy it before next year when we get an hour of Apple Intelligence 2.",333,1749499751.0,2025-06-09 20:09:11

mww5c64,thedonmoose,"I was actually really excited for a lot of the updates, especially as someone who came into this thinking it will be a miss:

- I like the overall design, I love that we have more floating UI
- I like the lockscreen changes
- I like all the new messages additions, I feel like everyone's been asking for more features and group typing animations
- I LOVED the Carplay changes, Live Activities + NO MORE FULL SCREEN CALLS
- Call screening + Call hold are amazing QoL features
- Live Translation (on paper) is very useful
- Apple Music live mixing or whatever that's called is sick
- Admitting the f'd up the Photos app and giving us back that tab was great

I am way more excited about features this iOS than last iOS. iPad OS was amazing too with the new files app, preview (both should have came to iPhone too btw) and inching it closer to MacOS. I was laughing when they showed the window management and the hidden menu bar, like bruh just let us boot MacOS already.

Additionally as a Mac user I really liked Live Activities syncing, shortcut updates, and ripping of Raycast (lol) but it was pretty barren of an update. Although you can only do so much. Funny seeing Vista-like UI elements on Mac almost two decades later though lol.

Biggest miss was obviously AI. I really wished they would have provided some deeper integration with third party AIs or something to bridge the gap. I love using Perplexity's Assistant mode and it feels like an alpha version of what an AI assistant looks like on iOS.",82,1749499849.0,2025-06-09 20:10:49
mww88m9,IM_KYLE_AMA,Just installed the dev beta and I think theres going to be some serious pushback on this redesign. The liquid glass doesnt really work at all like they showed in the demo and near full transparency of elements makes it incredibly hard to make out what Im looking at in certain instances.

mwwh3ul,loseniram,"Vision OS getting controller support and more entertainment/productivity updates for businesses is underrated.

The ability to have multiple personnel share a device and have shareable files that can be restricted via IT is very nice to have for industrial businesses like Automanufacturer design teams that can't justify buying like 10 Visions but could justify one or two with 12 user profiles. Hopefully Apple is smart and gives good tools to IT teams.

I'm hoping that these are signs that they are looking to release a 2000-2500 cheaper model that doesn't have the fancy stuff like the magnesium but keeps vision OS and the cpu.",5,1749503168.0,2025-06-09 21:06:08

mwwkxl2,dissected_gossamer,"This is what happens when hardware devices, operating systems, and apps are mature. There's nothing left to revolutionize. Nothing mind blowing left to unveil. Updates become evolutionary iterations, sometimes for better, sometimes for worse. It's often change for change's sake.

Think cars, refrigerators, toasters. Companies release new models every year with minor tweaks. Nothing mind blowing year after year. There aren't any companies coming out with 5 wheel cars, or cars that drive on their sides, or joysticks and buttons instead of steering wheels and pedals. These are mature products that have reached standardization.

Electronics have reached that point too. We've been at peak smartphones, peak laptops, peak computers, peak cameras, and peak operating systems for several years. Unless there are breakthroughs in physics, this is where we are for the foreseeable future.

Manage your expectations. Get used to not having your mind blown for a while. Just like cars. Just like refrigerators. Just like toasters. And that's ok.",1,1749504292.0,2025-06-09 21:24:52
