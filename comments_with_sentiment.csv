Who else is STOKED for the biggest ever update to iPadOS? This truly is the iPadOS for ultra pros!,Neutral
The iPad updates look to be surprisingly good - everything else was kinda meh other than Apple Music.,Positive
They better keep the option to reduce transparency after this update…or else,Positive
"Friendly warning to anyone who wants to try iOS 26 as someone who’s running the beta on an iPhone 15 Pro and iPad (10th generation):   It’s really, really laggy and broken.",Positive
"I was actually really excited for a lot of the updates, especially as someone who came into this thinking it will be a miss:  - I like the overall design, I love that we have more floating UI - I like the lockscreen changes - I like all the new messages additions, I feel like everyone's been asking for more features and group typing animations - I LOVED the Carplay changes, Live Activities + NO MORE FULL SCREEN CALLS - Call screening + Call hold are amazing QoL features - Live Translation (on paper) is very useful - Apple Music live mixing or whatever that's called is sick - Admitting the f'd up the Photos app and giving us back that tab was great  I am way more excited about features this iOS than last iOS. iPad OS was amazing too with the new files app, preview (both should have came to iPhone too btw) and inching it closer to MacOS. I was laughing when they showed the window management and the hidden menu bar, like bruh just let us boot MacOS already.  Additionally as a Mac user I really liked Live Activities syncing, shortcut updates, and ripping of Raycast (lol) but it was pretty barren of an update. Although you can only do so much. Funny seeing Vista-like UI elements on Mac almost two decades later though lol.  Biggest miss was obviously AI. I really wished they would have provided some deeper integration with third party AIs or something to bridge the gap. I love using Perplexity's Assistant mode and it feels like an alpha version of what an AI assistant looks like on iOS.",Positive
Just installed the dev beta and I think theres going to be some serious pushback on this redesign. The liquid glass doesnt really work at all like they showed in the demo and near full transparency of elements makes it incredibly hard to make out what Im looking at in certain instances. This is a huge regression in terms of design and accessibility standards.,Positive
iOS 26: Windows Vista edition,Neutral
"Overall, really pleased by everything that was released today. A modest redesign, more parity, new features. iPadOS was the big winner. Still looking forward to homeOS. 👀",Positive

"Not gonna lie, that opening F1-sequence was pretty badass",Positive
iPadOS update was too good Apple had to balance it out by ruining the UI for all their devices for the next decade,Positive
"Felt like some really good quality of life updates to iOS and CarPlay, looking forward to release in Sept/Oct.  The updated glass interface is nice looking and welcome, but doesn’t feel like something amazing and new like they were saying.",Positive
Vision OS getting controller support and more entertainment/productivity updates for businesses is underrated.  The ability to have multiple personnel share a device and have shareable files that can be restricted via IT is very nice to have for industrial businesses like Automanufacturer design teams that can't justify buying like 10 Visions but could justify one or two with 12 user profiles. Hopefully Apple is smart and gives good tools to IT teams.  I'm hoping that these are signs that they are looking to release a 2000-2500 cheaper model that doesn't have the fancy stuff like the magnesium but keeps vision OS and the cpu.,Positive
Love the iPad OS updates but I’m still bewildered there are no profiles in IPad OS.,Positive
"I’m really interested to see what devs do with the on-device models.  I think with all the concerns about AI’s ecological impact, a LOT of stuff we see in apps can be shifted to on-device models. And the fact that Apple is (to my knowledge) just letting devs have access to this for $99/yr is wild.",Positive
Feels like there’s a mismatch with what the product team hears and what customers want. People have been hoping for more stability and functional features. But instead it seems like visual branding stays a priority this year.,Positive

I feel like Apple has lost the plot. It's the worst WWDC in recent memory. Many of the parts of the keynote felt like they were included just to stretch the keynote to be long enough. A lot of the updates seem to be mid-2010s shallow tech UI updates rather than meeting the moment. 2/5 stars,Negative

"I made the mistake of falling for the rumor that this was going to showcase a significant re-design of the operating systems. It was a tweak.

My car is the first Apple CarPlay equipped I’ve owned so wondering if I’ll need to do anything for the new features like the smaller call banner.,Positive

"I just want Apple to focus on stability. I’im tired of having iOS and macOS performance to be directly tired to your wifi. Slow WiFi makes everything ultra buggy somehow.      I’m tired of safari on iOS becoming randomly unresponsive, apps to suddenly take ages to lunch on a M3MAX MacBook Pro, tired of the iOS camera deciding not to work or launch randomly. Basically, I’m tired of not being able to rely fully on my Apple devices.     New features, design, etc. are nice but the basics were left out for years now.",Negative
Anyone know how the iPadOs changes will look on an iPad mini?,Neutral
I'm testing the beta of iPadOS and can't share the enthusiasm. I don't see the point of having windows on the iPad. These can usually only be reduced in size to a certain extent... two windows and the screen is already full - I don't really see the point. We'll see... then give us MacOS for the iPad rather than this in-between thing... To all of you who are happy about windows and are already testing the beta: What exactly do you like about it - what is your usecase?,Positive
My biggest take away with the design language is that the accessibility aspect better be in a good place.  I like the transparency and the glass features coming back into style but the one thing that threw me was how Safari looked. That’s going to mess with folx with lower vision.   But I would expect Apple to have that under control. I just hope they do. Otherwise I know a number of elderly family and friends who won’t like the surprise change on iOS and iPadOS.   Tahoe on the other hand looks like it will be straightforward for upgrading company wide just like last year.,Positive

"Super intrigued for the possibility of using Apple intelligence as part of automation workflows, namely how it might work with Keyboard Maestro (which has some integration with Shortcuts I believe?)",Positive
How long must we wait for Apple to take Focus Modes seriously? Dumb phones are getting to be popular. I get ads for literal devices designed to brick your phone. It could be so simple for Apple to let you make a Focus Mode that hides all your apps except ones you need at work or what you need in bed or what you need for an emergency. And only show those apps! And only let those apps work when in that mode. It would also be cool to sandbox my work apps so I’m not tempted to peak at work emails when I’m at home and don’t get notifications from my pager app when I’m not on call.,Positive

Google is coming with Android XR and Veo 3. Microsoft is coming with a new Handheld and innovating on quantum computing and agentic AI.   Apple is giving us transparent icons and more responsive typeface. 😞.,Positive
My big takeaways   They have had a foldable in the works for sometime. The multitasking and windowing not so much. The UI screams multiple screens. A foldable is inbound (Mac/iPad hybrid?)  Lower end Vision Air also is near. Update is all about multiple devices that can collaborate and enjoy content in unison. Need to be able to afford more than one for that .  watchOS really needs an iPad software moment.,Positive
"Given that the last remaining meaningful distinctions between iPadOS and MacOS are disappearing - with now a menu bar, traditional window management, a proper file browser and a proper cursor - Why not just let people launch .app files?",Positive

"This is what happens when hardware devices, operating systems, and apps are mature. There's nothing left to revolutionize. Nothing mind blowing left to unveil. Updates become evolutionary iterations, sometimes for better, sometimes for worse. It's often change for change's sake.  Think cars, refrigerators, toasters. Companies release new models every year with minor tweaks. Nothing mind blowing year after year. There aren't any companies coming out with 5 wheel cars, or cars that drive on their sides, or joysticks and buttons instead of steering wheels and pedals. These are mature products that have reached standardization.  Electronics have reached that point too. We've been at peak smartphones, peak laptops, peak computers, peak cameras, and peak operating systems for several years. Unless there are breakthroughs in physics, this is where we are for the foreseeable future.  Manage your expectations. Get used to not having your mind blown for a while. Just like cars.

This is not iOS 26 and at MOST this should be iOS 18.5.0. This was the worst WWDC I think I’ve ever seen.

We’ve had CarPlay for how many years? It should’ve been this way from the start and not have to come through an OS update.,Positive
I feel like it tells a lot about a person whether they respond to good news with excitement vs “this should have been this way already”.,Positive
Apple adding markdown to Notes this week is already paying off!,Neutral

Here’s hoping for a cross platform Classical Music app to follow.,Neutral
What. 100!!,Neutral
The CarPlay fix for the stupid full screen incoming calls was the biggest star of WWDC,Negative
">Apple not too worried about what happens after 2099  At that point, they will reuse. Only Reddit will be saying ""Wait you used that 50+ years ago!""",Neutral
Friend mentioned being very pleased with CachyOS just yesterday.,Positive
"Generally speaking, if the model works with one distro, any should work(assuming we are talking up to date with somewhat recentish kernels). IMO, research if your model supports Linux period, then research which distros stances on things matches up with your approach.  Just comes down to pref of de/wm, package management and w/e else comes with that distro. My personal rec is, if you want stable, old, but rock solid distro, Debian. Most up to date packages, Arch. Tbh, arch being unstable is kinda overblown, I run light maintenance(literally package updates) on my machine and it's coasted for years. Nothing's broken.",Positive
"I mean you can do that already, minus the two monitors",Negative
"> ever since iPadOS split off from iOS  But it didn't. They both use the same APIs. The only real difference between the two is iPad uses split screen and has peripheral support.  As far as developing between the two, all devs see is a different screen size",Positive
iPadOS runs only mobile apps so it's not a variant of macOS.  But I never understood iPad without having the ability to multitask. Now I am not still convinced anyway.,Neutral
"This happened with 7 too, although 7 was way out there, I can see 26 being tweaked a bit and coming into compliance.",Neutral
Have to make a reason for the >3 year old devices to slow down juuuuust enough to make it annoying as hell to use so the new ones get bought I guess,Negative
So you’re telling me I shouldn’t install this on my 13 Pro Max?,Neutral
If windows vista did it in 2007 I doubt it’s *that* intense.,Positive
Every year people say it’s so slow and after it indexes it’s fine lol yep,Positive
Sometimes the iOS betas are pretty good to be honest.,Positive
Yes but 3 months to fix this seems a bit worrysome 😅,Neutral
"Still, even as the first beta, you mean to tell me that for however many months/years, none of the dozens/hundreds of people at Apple that worked on this UI found any issue at all with the legibility of text?  There's ""this feature is still being refined and may have bugs"" type of issues, and then there's ""we did this day one and never saw anything wrong with it, why are you complaining/using it wrong"" type of issues. This is the latter.",Negative
Nope. He’s wrong,Negative
Glad you like it. As a professional designer I will never use any of this in my work and I doubt others will either. Especially since some of it like the full liquid glass effect can’t be replicated in browsers.,Positive
"You can't just say ""wrong"" to dismiss other peoples opinions.  Plus, your video is going over the most simple type of relatively plain content possible (Wikipedia). Make a video in the Apple Music app instead.",Negative
You are using threads. Opinion discarded. You are now dismissed.,Neutral
"When Apple's Aqua UI debuted, it was all about glossy buttons and pinstripes everywhere. I don't recall any translucent glass or blurring. Windows Aero was different from Aqua- translucent glass windows and menu bars that would blur everything behind them. It looked nice.  OS X didn't start doing that until after Windows Vista.  Compare any version of OS X from 2001 to 2006 to Vista. They look totally different. OS X went from candy buttons and pinstripes, to brushed metal. Nothing like Vista.",Positive
"The worst parts of transparency bleeding colors behind your windows, started in macOS Mojave, now cranked up all the way.",Negative
"lol, no. I still remember the laughs during Steve jobs keynote when he showed Leopard (iirc) desktop and people thought it was a Windows Vista pun… then they realised…",Positive
"Yeah, that's before my time 😬",Neutral
"And then Apple said, let’s copy the worse things from vista",Negative
Exactly,Positive
"Aqua wasn’t this translucent glass style at all. It was glossy buttons and striping. It was fresh and very cool.  This is way closer to Vista’s design language, which yes, Apple borrowed from for their VR OS- and to be fair they did a beautiful job.  It works very well for a 3D spatial OS- there’s real life stuff behind the windows in real time.   On a phone, this looks like a headache imo.  I don’t like it lol",Positive
Why are you so obsessed with this that you have to comment about this specific thing multiple times?,Negative
"Shareholders want Apple to raise their stock price by becoming more profitable, which happens when you sell to customers. What is this bad logic ? Maybe most people aren't power users on reddit who have no care for aesthetics and apple's billion dollar team know who they are designing for.",Positive
What phones do you think these shareholders use?,Neutral
I didn’t feel this way about 2023 or 2024 fwiw,Neutral
"Correct, and that illustrates appallingly bad steward ship from CEO Tim Cook whose job it is to deliver.",Negative
1000000%  Fuck their mentality. I’m tired of stupid trolls lol,Negative
"Honestly, yeah. They’re Apple.",Positive
Thanks! That’s a relief🙏🏻,Positive
No. You can only turn off notifications for apps,Neutral
It’s very… bubbly. I enjoy that aspect of the liquid glass. I haven’t noticed readability being difficult.   It does feel very beta-ey. Things don’t pop up quickly or as easily.,Positive
"this is from the apple website: **Apple Wallet** can now identify and summarize order tracking details from emails sent from merchants or delivery carriers. This works across all of a user’s orders, giving them the ability to see their full order details, progress notifications, and more, all in one place.",Positive
"Hmm then what's the difference in the new version? I thought it already did that, i'm seeing conflicting answers to this",Positive
Can’t agree more,Positive
"This is a standard antisocial behavior for humans, so much so that every every language has a word for it.  In English the word is “killjoy,” being person who deliberately spoils the enjoyment of others through resentful or overly sober behavior.  Trolling is as old as humanity.",Positive
It was the only time I literally paused the stream. I couldn't believe my eyes lmao,Positive
I haven’t heard of this. Will have a look.,Neutral
Awesome info.  Thanks 🙏🏻   It’s sounds like Debian will be making its way back into my life again!,Positive
"It’s not a mobile it’s not a laptop. It used to be a mobile with larger screen and interactive interface now it’s even less that.  And the worse of all is, it’s priced more than a laptop",Negative
It’s the first iteration of a beta version of a completely new system. They’re not spending any time making it intentionally worse on any device.,Negative
"Check out r/iosbeta. People are saying that after the initial indexing is done, it runs a lot smoother",Neutral
Vista did transparency and blur. This is doing that in addition to refraction simulations.,Neutral
"It’s so annoying. X was filled with these people. “I just downloaded and installed a brand new major version of OS and my phone is so laggy don’t do it!” Meanwhile, their phone is still 200 degrees since it just finished the update while being plugged in.  Let the phone cooldown and the background processes finish and it’s not as bad. It’s not perfect. But it’s not a sluggish, horrible mess.",Negative
They were always good and I feel like I could pinpoint exactly when they went to shit and it was the introduction of SwiftUI in iOS 13.,Positive
Developer beta is always very buggy. First public beta is usually pretty solid,Positive
This happens every single year. It’s almost always fine by launch,Positive
I heard the same shit about iOS 7.,Negative
I don’t sub to music .

"> I don't recall any translucent glass or blurring.  [Really?](https://babich.biz/content/images/2022/08/aqua_button-2.jpg)  From the [developer documentation](https://web.archive.org/web/20081007191229/https://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/UserExperience/chapter_6_section_2.html):   _""Aqua applications incorporate color, depth, **translucence**, and complex textures into a visually appealing interface.""_",Positive
Aero was obviously primarily inspired by Aqua. Attention was drawn to this at the time.,Positive
"It was all about liquidy buttons and transparency everywhere, including windows and menus.",Neutral
A phone UI design faithful to aqua actually sounds pretty awesome.,Positive
Why are people incorrectly attributing it to Aero and not Apple’s Aqua and spatial interface?   Why are you upset that I’m correcting it?,Neutral
"Regardless of that, shareholders do not and should never represent a consumer base",Negative
"Irrelevant. The point here is that putting time, money, effort, resources into a shiny new interface is is better for the short term bottom line",Positive
"Ah cool, it was just a half joke but every year someone says it was the worst WWDC ever",Negative
"Huh. How do I have different home screens set up, then? 🤔 I’ll have to figure that out",Neutral
They’re not spending any time making it intentionally optimized either,Neutral
SwiftUI is 🗑️,Neutral
A redesign happens every single year? A taxating glass layer ? 😅,Negative
Nope. Couldn’t disagree more,Positive
"Thanks for sharing that. In my opinion, when there is a colored button like the blue ""Library"" in your video, the text is very very difficult to read.   Also, when you tap the filter button, the ""..."" that appears is barely visible at all.  IMO it would look better if it were less transparent, or had increased background blur. But right now things that overlap blend into each other too much.",Positive
"Your resources are *after* the release of Vista and few years after the presentation of Vista. He is right. And the button doesn't mean whole windows, notifications and toolbars were translucent.",Negative
I wouldn’t mind that honestly. I had a really sweet reskin on my S 22 Ultra that was based on Aqua. Had the NyQuil gel cap buttons and all lol,Positive
"Because it’s irrelevant. It doesn’t matter Apple used it a billion years ago, this just heavily reminds people of Aero/Vista so they’ll make fun of it using that example. You can make your own jokes using Aqua but likely no one will laugh. You’ll feel like you’re the smartest person in the room though!🤓",Positive
Couldn’t disagree more with your disagreement.   Best of luck to you though. Have a great day!,Positive
"> Your resources are after the release of Vista and few years after the presentation of Vista.  I didn't say anything about Vista.  But aqua in Mac OS was introduced in 2001, Vista was 2006.  > the button doesn't mean whole windows, notifications and toolbars were translucent.  I was replying to someone who said ""I don't recall _**any**_ translucent glass or blurring"" ... but here you go:   [translucent window title bars [OS 10 DP3, 2000]](https://ismh.s3.amazonaws.com/macosxdp3.png)   [translucent window title bars, menus, dock [OS 10 DP4, 2000]](https://guidebookgallery.org/pics/gui/desktop/full/macosxdp4.png)   [translucent menus [OS 10.0.4, 2001]](https://ismh.s3.amazonaws.com/macosx100.png)   [more translucency [Jaguar, 2002]](https://ismh.s3.amazonaws.com/2014-04-22-jaguar.png)",Negative
He’s worried Apple’s feelings will get hurt,Neutral
Lol,Positive
lol 😂,Positive
"You cut from the context ""OS X didn't start doing that until after Windows Vista.""",Neutral
2000 comes before 2006,Neutral
Great. Vista looking macOS it is anyway.     Actually not even that.,Positive
